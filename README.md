# Yelpcamp2022_v0

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About the project
YelpCamp is a full-stack responsive website. Users can create and review campgrounds with geocoding. In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account. This project is a part of Colt Steele's web dev bootcamp course on Udemy.
This project is being created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js is used to handle authentication.

## üöÄ Functionalities
>Everyone can view the camps and reviews without signing up or logging in.

>The user will have to login to edit the campground details or any comments.

>The user can only edit/delete the campgrounds and comments that they have added.

>All the data will be persistent and is stored in the mongoDB.

## üöÄ Technologies Used:
>HTML5 - markup language for creating web pages and web applications

>CSS3 - used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
